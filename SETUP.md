## Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

We recommend using a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

### Using `venv` (built into Python)
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

# Activate venv (Windows)
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
# Activate venv (Linux/Mac)
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
# Install venv requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
